> Basic Python scripts for getting sunset/sunrise info to display on a TM1637 7-segment display on Raspberry Pi

This is just a/some script(s) for getting some interesting info like the day's sunrise, sunset, moon phase, etc. and displaying that on a TM1637 7 segment display. Using this on a Raspberry Pi Zero.

Good if you're looking for some example scripts to do geocoding and data parsing from random APIs in Python.

Will update with more detailed instructions if this repo gets more interesting or complicated than just a simple Python script.
